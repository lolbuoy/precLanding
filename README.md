# precLanding
precision landing using jevois data, PID controller and python for Arducopter and Arduplane (QPlane)
ideally you would have ardupilot SITL setup and running, mavlink-router/mavproxy would be useful for networking as well
run *bash copter.sh* to start the sitl
then *premovement.py*, this script will give you access to your UAV's movement with your keyboard
then run *jevoisMovement.py*
